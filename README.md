## Password Analyzer Tool

## Overview

The Password Analyzer is a comprehensive tool designed to evaluate the strength of user passwords and provide detailed reports on potential vulnerabilities. It assesses various factors that contribute to password security, including common usage patterns, personal information matches, and susceptibility to both dictionary and brute-force attacks. The tool also offers actionable recommendations to enhance password security.

## Key Features

1. Password Strength Analysis: Evaluates the strength of passwords based on length, character diversity, and overall complexity. This helps users understand how robust their passwords are against potential threats.

2. Common Password Detection: Identifies if the password is among a list of commonly used passwords, which are more susceptible to attacks. This feature helps in avoiding passwords that are easily guessable.

3. Personal Information Matching: Checks if the password includes personal information such as names, dates of birth, email addresses, or phone numbers. This ensures that passwords are not easily guessable through personal data.

4. Dictionary Attack Simulation: Assesses the password's vulnerability to dictionary attacks, where attackers use precompiled lists of common words and phrases to crack passwords.

5. Brute-Force Attack Simulation: Estimates the time required to crack the password using brute-force methods, where every possible combination is tried until the correct one is found. This provides insight into the password's resilience against exhaustive search attacks.

6. Personalized Recommendations: Offers tailored suggestions for improving password security based on the analysis results. These recommendations help users create stronger, more secure passwords.
